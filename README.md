# discord-purge-command
This Command allows Staff Members to purge messages, whether thats from spam, or just messages that needs to be Deleted! It deletes up to 100 messages!

This Command was built for Discord.js v13, and for V13 only. Feel free to convert to v12 if you are rocking the old discord.js!

People with MANAGE_MESSAGES can use this command, but that can be changed to another permission like ADMINISTRATOR, BAN_MEMBERS or something else, even a role id could be used if you change the code! 

I have put credits in the description of the command, and I would like to ask you to keep it in there, as I coded this command myself and I am providing it to you too. 

Thanks, and hope you enjoy!
